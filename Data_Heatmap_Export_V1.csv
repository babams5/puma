Vulnerability,Automotive,4,1,4033,Vulnerability refers to the inability (of a system or a unit) to withstand the effects of a hostile environment. A window of vulnerability(WOV) is a time frame within which defensive measures are diminished or compromised or lacking.
Virtualization,Automotive,0,2,1337,In computing virtualization refers to the act of creating a virtual (rather than actual) version of something including virtual computer hardware platforms storage devices and computer network resources.
Time to market,Automotive,1,3,1671,Time to market is the length of time it takes from a product being conceived until its being available for sale.
Tensions and international conflicts,Automotive,8,4,6534,War arises because of the changing relations of numerous variables--technological/psychic/social/intellectual. There is no single cause of war. Peace is an equilibrium among many forces. Change in any particular force/trend/movement/policy may at one time make for war but under other conditions a similar change may make for peace.
Sustainability,Automotive,8,5,6613,In ecology sustainability is the property of biological systems to remain diverse and productive indefinitely.
Sector convergence,Automotive,2,6,2443,Sector convergence represents growth potentials for organisations redefining the boundaries between industries. 
Disruptive business models,Automotive,10,7,7510,An innovation that creates a new market and value network and eventually disrupts an existing market and value network, displacing established market leading firms/products and alliances.
Demographic changes,Automotive,1,8,1833,Demographic change describes a population's age structure adjusting to changes in living conditions.
Decentralization,Automotive,2,9,2539,Decentralization is the process of distributing or dispersing functions/powers/people or things away from a central location or authority.
Data explosion,Automotive,3,10,3511,The data explosion is the rapid increase in the amount of published information or data and the effects of this abundance.
Customer Demand,Automotive,10,11,7784,A measure of consumers' desire for a product or service based on its availability.
